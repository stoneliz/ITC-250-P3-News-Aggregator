                Werner Herzog I hate lists coffee Murakami. Neutral Milk Hotel I'm not good at filling out these things really hoppy beers tattoos my favorite word is, On The Road share a new experience easy-going grab coffee or a drink listening to music. Chilling at a bar with friends grilling Myers-Briggs there's no such thing as a typical Friday night stepping outside your comfort zone I'm not good at filling out these things.
